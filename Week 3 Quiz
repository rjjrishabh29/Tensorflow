1.What is a Convolution?
     A technique to isolate features in images
      
  
  
2. What is a Pooling?
     A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features


3.How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
     They isolate features in images
      


4. After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?
      26*26


5. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?
      13*13



6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:
       It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
